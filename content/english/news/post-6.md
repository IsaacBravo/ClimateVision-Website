We are looking forward to partaking in the Sixth International and Interdisciplinary Conference on the Quantitative and Computational Analysis of Textual Data (COMPTEXT) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, May 2-4, 2024.

COMPTEXT is an international community of quantitative text analysis and computational social science scholars in political science, international relations and beyond. COMPTEXT 2024 in Amsterdam follows in the footsteps of previous conferences in Budapest (2018), Tokyo (2019) and Innsbruck (online, 2020), Dublin (2022), and Glasgow (2023). COMPTEXT conferences offer ample opportunities to network with computational scholars, to exchange technological knowledge of computational methods, and to obtain useful feedback on ongoing research.
