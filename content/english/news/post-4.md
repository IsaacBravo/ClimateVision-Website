Climate Vision Project on behalf of Stefanie Walter, PhD (TU Munich) hosted along with Prof. Dr. Mike S. Sch√§fer (University of Zurich) this workshop on 12 June 2023. In the workshop, it was discuss the state of the research field that analyzes climate change visuals, how computational approaches can help in the study of climate change imagery, the respective methods of data acquisition and analyses, as well as the specifics of collaboration between the social and computer sciences.

#### Details of the Event:
Computational methods are becoming increasingly popular among social scientists. Large amounts of data are being generated and made publicly available every day. However, it is still only a small number of researchers who have the methodological knowledge or are skilled in using computational methods which make this data so valuable. Large scale initiatives, such as quanteda have lowered the barriers to use Natural Language Processing and quantitative text analysis methods. However, these endeavours have to a very large extent been limited to textual data, following the traditional approach to content analysis that is focused on texts. Images and advances in the area of image analysis have been neglected, leaving gaps in the potential that these data sources offer. This is a big omission given that images are especially prevalent in online environments and on social media in particular. In this workshop, we want to bring together scholars working on image analysis (especially with focus on climate change) and discuss questions related to data access and analysis. Regarding the latter, we are particularly interested in exploring the challenges and opportunities that collaborations with computer scientists bring.

#### General Objectives:
<li>Explore state of the art on climate visuals in news and social media</li>
<li>Discuss challenges and opportunities of communicating climate change via images</li>
<li>Share experiences and insights on visualizing climate change data in social sciences research and practice</li>
<li>Build network of researchers and experts in the field of climate change communication in social sciences</li>
