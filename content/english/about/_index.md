The <strong>ClimateVision Project</strong> serves as a comprehensive exploration of the pivotal role images play in the discourse surrounding climate change. While computational methods have notably advanced text analysis within the realms of political and social sciences, scant attention has been devoted to leveraging images as a potent medium for eliciting emotional responses and shaping public perception. Despite the burgeoning availability of large datasets and the proliferation of social media platforms facilitating the dissemination of visual content, a critical gap persists in understanding the nuanced interplay between images, societal attitudes, and political mobilization concerning climate change. This project thus endeavors to address this lacuna by delving into the dynamics of image consumption and reception on social media platforms, seeking to unravel the complex relationship between visual narratives of climate change and their impact on user engagement and sentiment.

Moreover, against the backdrop of escalating environmental concerns and the surge of youth-led protest movements such as Fridays For Future, the significance of visual imagery in fostering political participation and galvanizing collective action has become increasingly apparent. By investigating the types of images that evoke robust reactions and emotional responses among social media users, this project aims to elucidate the mechanisms through which visual narratives of climate change resonate within online communities. Through a multidisciplinary approach integrating insights from computational social science, political psychology, and media studies, this inquiry seeks to contribute valuable insights into harnessing the communicative power of images to advance discourse, advocacy, and public engagement surrounding the pressing issue of climate change.
