In today's digital age, images play a pivotal role in shaping our understanding of complex phenomena like climate change. To empower the social science communities in their quest for deeper insights, we're thrilled to introduce the Image Analysis Toolbox â€” a cutting-edge resource designed to contribute to the study of climate change through the lens of imagery. This tool-box will provide open-access to researchers, including:

> <li style="font-size: 20px;">Automated Image Analysis</li> <li style="font-size: 20px;">Image Clustering</li> <li style="font-size: 20px;">Detection of Manipulated Images</li> 

By establishing image analysis as a computational social science method, our toolbox allows researchers to unlock new dimensions of understanding in the field of climate change. Stay tuned for the official release of the Image Analysis Toolbox, and together, let's embark on a transformative exploration of climate change imagery.
